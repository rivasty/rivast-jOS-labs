1. If we use seperate handler functions for each exception/interupt, we can have different ways of handling certain things if we want. Otherwise all exceptions have the same handler and can not be overwritten by the user.
2. I did not have to do anything. This is because DPL is set to 0 on the handler, and the CPU will call a General Protection Fault.
3. For breakpoints to work the DPL for the breakpoint handler needs to be set to 3, allowing the user to invoke the handler.
4. To prevent the user from invoking these interupts and messing with the kernal.
